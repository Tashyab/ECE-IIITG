The Character class is a subclass of Object class and it wraps a value of the primitive type char in an object.
An object of type Character contains a single field whose type is char.
We can check whether the given character in a string is a number/letter by using isDigit() method of Character class.
The isDigit() method is a static method and determines if the specified character is a digit.
